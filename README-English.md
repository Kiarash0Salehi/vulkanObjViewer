# 3D model viewer
This project can be used to load and view 3D model objects\
In this project I used Vulkan and win32 api to compute and render using GPU (Graphics processing unit) and win32 window to display it


## How to use

simply run the executable program in the release directory and drag and drop your .obj 3D model in the program 

you can hold right mouse key and rotate the mesh in X and Y axis and scroll to zoom in and zoom out
And use W S keys on the keyboard to move in Z axis
